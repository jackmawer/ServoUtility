Servo Utility (formally WhiteRose and ZACKUpdater) is a cross-platform .NET library to build FreeSO update and launcher utilities. The library is capable of launching FreeSO, Volcanic, or a hard coded third party application. By default the former two must be located in the same directory as the library but this not required may be changed by the user in an ini file.
