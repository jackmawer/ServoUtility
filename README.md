The My Simulation Launcher is a Servo Utility front-end used to update and launch FreeSO. It's the direct successor to the [Blue Rose project](https://github.com/mysimulation/BlueRoseClassic).

* This utility must be placed in the **same folder** as FreeSO. If it isn't this may be changed in ServoUtility.ini
